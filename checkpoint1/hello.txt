Hi! My name is Andre :) I'm a freshman from the school of engineering. I plan on being a CS-major and minoring in something undecided (I'm debating from linguistics and stamps to math and stats haha). A fun fact about me is that I am fluent in Bulgarian and have been on Icelandic national television.
